# Isabelle and Tito are getting married!

Hi! My name is Tito, I'm a developer very passionate for coding but much more passionate for a girl called Isabelle ❤️
And now, we're getting married! 💍 I developed this simple site to help us to announce our wedding and to help our guests
and friends to find our wedding stream and other informations, but also as a remembrance for our future and, maybe, 
our sons (if they like to code 👶💻). It is built on Angular with Bootstrap CSS, Material and some kludge 🔧

It also integrates with an ASP.NET based API (not using it fully) called Amalgam, in which I've been working on and I will 
(I hope I will) make it public in the not so far future.

I hope you enjoy this code and also fall in love with someone! 💞

Com carinho,  
Tito Silva
